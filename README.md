# **_Walk With Tyson_**


## Introduction 

The mission of the website, Walk With Tyson is to enhance the bond between dogs and their owners
through purposeful and enjoyable walks. Tyson is the name of my dog, a three year old German
Shepherd boy, therefore the title Walk With Tyson. This site would enable dog owners to sign up
for different trails in Dublin and Wicklow, where all dog owners can meet up at a point and go on
walks together. This session would help to socialise the dogs better in a more relaxed environment.
This would also give an opportunity for the dog owners to discuss their challenges and doubts in
bringing up a dog with good health and behaviour.

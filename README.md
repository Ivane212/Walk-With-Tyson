#Walk With Tyson

##Introduction

The mission of the website, Walk With Tyson is to enhance the bond between dogs and their owners through purposeful and enjoyable walks. Tyson is the name of my dog, a three year old German Shepherd boy, therefore the title "Walk With Tyson." This site would enable dog owners to sign up for different trails in Dublin and Wicklow, where all dog owners can meet up at a point and go on walks together. This session would help to A the dogs better in a more relaxed environment. This would also give an opportunity for the dog owners to discuss their challenges and doubts in bringing up a dog with good health and behaviour.

User Experience - UX
As a web designer, my aim is to:

•	Create a website that is user friendly and looks interesting.
•	Make the navigation simple for the users.
•	To give an idea to users (dog owners) about Tyson so that they can decide if he is compatible with their dogs. 
•	To make users understand the purpose of the page and walks.
•	To make it easy for the users to find out all the trails and details.
•	To enable signing- up for the walks without any technical difficulty. 

Design

Website Structure
The website consists of four pages: Home, Tyson's life, Images and Walkies.  Home page consists of header, main and footer. This page is linked to the other three pages by the navigation menu on the top. 

Interactive Links
Users can access the link for social media at the bottom of all the four pages. On clicking the icons for Facebook, X(Twitter), YouTube and Instagram that are listed at the bottom users will leave the website and a new tab will be opened.

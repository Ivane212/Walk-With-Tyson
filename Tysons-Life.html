                    <span class="span1">
                        Three years ago, on a bright march afternoon me and my wife set our journey from Dublin to a
                        countryside home in Kildare.
                        If you are wondering why, that’s the day we made Tyson our baby.</span> <span class="span2">
                        Throughout our drive we were trying to find a name for him. We thought of lot of names,
                        but we were so confused, kind of not happy with any name for our first ever baby. </span> <span
                        class="span3">
                        Anyways after a long drive through the country roads we pulled into this beautiful bungalow.
                        As we came out of the car here comes a gorgeous long haired German Sheperd. </span><span
                        class="span4">
                        He is so huge and majestic like a lion, and first thing he did is he jumped on me.
                        Now you know where Tyson got his jumping habits from. Yes, he was Tyson’s biological father and
                        the father’s name is Tyson.
                        So here we go. Problem sorted! We decided to name our baby</span> <i

                    <br>
                    <span class="span3">after his biological father,
                        and we came up with the name Tyson Jnr. though, we ended up calling him Tyson Gelashvili at the
                        end.
                        We also met Mary, his biological mum a short haired German Shepherd and walked towards the horse
                        shed, </span><span class="span2">
                        said hi to the two beautiful horses. That’s when we saw the little guy coming to us from the
                        back of the shed.
                        That was love at first sight, he was chubby, with a round face and floppy ears. </span><span
                        class="span4">
                        I picked him up and hugged him. The moment of joy and excitement. So, we decided to go home with
                        the guy who came to us.
                        In other words, he picked us instead of us picking him. As they say it, dogs have a way of
                        finding their humans.</span>

                <h2>Challenges <i class="fa-solid fa-bone"></i></h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="span2"> Getting a dog is like having a child. It is a lifetime commitment and it comes with many challenges.
                    One of the main challenges is training. It gets even harder when you live in an apartment.
                    For instance, potty training could have been easier if we were living in a house, but bringing him
                    down to the</span><span
                    class="span4">
                    garden from the fourth floor every time he pees wasn’t an option for us. But the training pads were
                    very helpful.
                    At the start, for about a month or two we put those pads everywhere and any time we see him having
                    an accident,
                    we picked him up and put him on the pads. Gradually he started to grasp things and started going to
                    pads himself</span><span class="span3">
                    when he had to do his business. Every time he does it right, he got rewarded. Now that he is getting
                    better with
                    his training, we cut down the number of pads and gradually it was just one pad at the balcony. In no
                    time Tyson
                    realised our aim and finally we reached the goal through continuous efforts and patience. When he
                    was about six to
                    seven months his bladder control started getting much stronger and ever since then we said goodbye
                    to the pads.</span> 
                    <br>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <br>
                    <span class="span1">
                    He started doing his business only when he is on walks, and we made sure that he gets minimum three
                    walks a day.
                    Some of the other challenges were leash training, greeting and meeting other people/dogs and
                    obviously as puppies
                    they are more vulnerable to diseases. Tyson started getting some skin allergies that went way
                    itself. Apparently</span><span class="span2">
                    according to vets, German Shepherds are prone to developing uncomfortable itching and allergic skin
                    reactions.
                    Further to that, sensitive stomachs and diarrhoea are almost a hallmark of German Shepherds.
                    Tyson started developing chronic diarrhoea when he was about six months and he was under controlled
                    diet for a
                    long time period until his stomach started getting stronger by the age of two and a half years.</span>
